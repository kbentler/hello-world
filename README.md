Wildlife Radio Homing Drone
I am trying to make a UAS (Unmanned Aerial
System, aka drone) that will seek out VHF radio collars on raccoons (wild
raccoons that have been trapped, collared, and released as part of one of my
studies). The drone would carry a device to download GPS
coordinates collected by a GPS receiver on the collar while the animals are
going about their lives. Instead of walking out into the bush to download
the GPS data, I want the drone to do it for me. Therefore the drone needs to hover over the collar.
Ideally, it would also be nice if
some kind of GPS download feedback could be obtained to let the operator on the
ground know that the data has been acquired.
I don't know how to program, code, nada. Okay, maybe not nada.
I get the basic idea behind algorithms and understand some commands, but
I am not at all proficient with programming.
